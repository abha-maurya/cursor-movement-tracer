Interactive Solar System Simulation
This React-based application visually represents our solar system with an interactive twist. A spacecraft dynamically follows the user's cursor, simulating a journey through space. When hovering over any planet, the app utilizes speech synthesis to announce the planetâ€™s name, providing an immersive, auditory experience. In addition, the current coordinates of the cursor are displayed at the top of the screen, offering real-time tracking of user movement. This engaging and educational app seamlessly integrates space exploration with modern web technologies, offering a playful way to learn about our solar system.
